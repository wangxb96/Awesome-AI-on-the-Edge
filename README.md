## Background Knowledge
### Edge Computing
**Definition:** Edge computing is a distributed computing paradigm that brings computation and data storage closer to the sources of data. This is expected to improve response times and save bandwidth.

**Edge Device:** An edge device is a device that provides an entry point into enterprise or service provider core networks. Examples include routers, routing switches, integrated access devices (IADs), multiplexers, and a variety of metropolitan area network (MAN) and wide area network (WAN) access devices.

### Edge AI
**Edge AI** is a combination of Edge Computing and Artificial Intelligence. **Edge computing** is a distributed computing paradigm that brings computation and data storage closer to the location of the device. **Artificial Intelligence** algorithms process the data that are created on the device with or without having any internet connection. This allows data to be processed within a few milliseconds providing real-time feedback. *Edge AI is a system that uses Machine Learning algorithms to process data generated by a hardware device at the local level.*
