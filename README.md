## Background Knowledge
### Edge Computing
**Definition:** Edge computing is a distributed computing paradigm that brings computation and data storage closer to the sources of data. This is expected to improve response times and save bandwidth.

**The edge computing infrastructure:**

**Edge Device:** An edge device is a device that provides an entry point into enterprise or service provider core networks. Examples include routers, routing switches, integrated access devices (IADs), multiplexers, and a variety of metropolitan area network (MAN) and wide area network (WAN) access devices.

### Edge AI
**Edge AI** is a combination of Edge Computing and Artificial Intelligence. *Edge computing* is a distributed computing paradigm that brings computation and data storage closer to the location of the device. *Artificial Intelligence* algorithms process the data that are created on the device with or without having any internet connection. This allows data to be processed within a few milliseconds providing real-time feedback. *Edge AI* is a system that uses Machine Learning algorithms to process data generated by a hardware device at the local level.

**Advantages:** 
- **Real-Time Analytics:** Real-time analytics is a major advantage of Edge Computing. Edge AI brings high-performance computing capabilities to the edge, where sensors and IoT devices are located.
- **Reduced Latency:** Transfer of data back & forth from the cloud takes time. Edge AI reduces latency by processing data locally (at the device level).
- **High Speed:** Data is processed locally which significantly improves processing speed as compared to cloud computing.
- **Reduced Bandwidth Requirement and Cost:** Edge AI processes the data locally on the device itself, reducing the cost of internet bandwidth and cloud storage.
- **Improved Data Security:** Edge AI systems perform the majority of data processing locally i.e. on the edge device itself. This greatly reduces the amount of data that is sent to the cloud and other external locations. This eliminates the exposure of sensitive data to cyber-criminals.
- **Scalability:** Edge AI typically processes large amounts of data. If you have to process video image data from many different sources simultaneously, transferring the data to a cloud service is not required.
- **Improved Reliability:** Higher levels of security combined with greater speed produce greater the reliability of Edge AI System.
- **Reduced Cost:** AI processing is working on the edge of the device so it is highly cost-cost efficient because only processed, data required or valuable data is sent to the cloud.
- **Reduced Power:** Edge AI processes data at the device level so it saves energy costs.

**Edge AI devices:**
- Smartphones
- Laptops
- Smart Driven cars
- Raspberry PI
